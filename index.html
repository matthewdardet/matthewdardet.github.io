  <p><span class = "newthought"> I am a Ph.D. student</span> in <a href="https://gov.harvard.edu/">Government</a> at Harvard University. I graduated with distinction from Stanford University in June 2021 with a B.A.H. in Political Science and a Minor in History and Law.</p>

  <p> My research integrates methodology, public opinion, and psychology to more precisely investigate political phenomena within the American context. My latest work seeks to improve survey data quality using questionnaire design, experiments, and machine learning, and I have recently completed a book manuscript on contingent valuation, a survey-based econometric method used to estimate the economic values of public goods such as governmental policies and environmental or natural resources. </p>
