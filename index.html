  <p><span class = "newthought"> I am a Ph.D. student</span> in <a href="https://gov.harvard.edu/">Government</a> at Harvard University. My research integrates survey methodology, public opinion, and psychology to more precisely investigate political phenomena within the American context. My latest work seeks to improve survey data quality using questionnaire design, experiments, and machine learning. I also works on contingent valuation, a survey-based econometric method used to estimate the economic values of public goods such as governmental policies and environmental or natural resources. </p>
